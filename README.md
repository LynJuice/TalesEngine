## TalesEngine 2.0
TalesEngine is currently moving from OpenGL to Vulkan and is being rewritten from scratch, the engine is still in heavy development and is not recommended for production use.

## Getting started
We recommend to clone your own private fork, then start creating your projects.

### Windows
1. Install [GitHub Desktop for Windows](https://desktop.github.com/) then [fork and clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) you will also need [Cmake](https://cmake.org/). After installing Cmake and setting up a fork Open [Visual studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) run the following commands
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
 2. after running the commands you should notice that a new folder filled with files has been created if your using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) open the .sln file and select the release build 
 ### Usage
Currently the engine is not ready for production, however you can use it for testing and development.

### Licensing
All we ask for is for you to mention that your project has been made using TalesEngine somewhere in your program.
